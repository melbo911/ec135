Description
===========

This little LUA script is a mod to the "artificial stability" (AS) settings of the brilliant Rotorsim EC135 V5

 

It applies a little modification to the "high-speed" setting, which eliminates over-reaction on the pitch axis on fast yaw rotations.
 

The video below shows the difference of with and without the mod. 3 takeoffs without it, short landing to change the settings and 3 takeoffs with mod enabled.

If loaded, it also provides a new command which can be assigned to a joystick button or key. With this command you can switch the mod on or off during flight.

In addition to the high-speed settings change, it reduces the sensitivity for Roll and Pitch if SAS is turned off.
